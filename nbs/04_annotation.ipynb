In order to do this, we will use the [```Imshow```](https://plotly.com/python/imshow/) chart from the ```Plotly``` library. There are [ways](https://dash.plotly.com/annotations) of linking this figure into the application. Fortunately or unfortunately, it is not possible to keep one plot object with an image inside it. Instead, the figure needs to be made again and again for each image fed into it. Then, this plot is wrapped in the ```Graph``` object from the ```Dash``` library to be given an ```id``` for callback features. This wrapping needs to be handled in the ```Dash``` app itself, not the view calls.\n",

    "In an LED monitor, every pixel is made of a red, blue, and green LED that will show different intensities of colored light. Combining these pixels together into one system allows us to display images, movies, videos, etc... by coordingating the display of colors for each LED in each pixel of a monitor. What does this have to do with images? In mathematical terms, we might say that an image $I$ will have scalar intensities associated to three different coordinates. The first are the traditional $(x,y)$ Cartesian coordinate structure, but the third coordinate is color. We might say then that an individual LED at some position on the monitor will display the value $I(x_0,y_0,c)$ at the LED (where $c$ is theoretically the associated color channel). Most monitors use RGB (where red is the first index, green is the second index, and green is the third index), but the ```cv2``` library uses the BGR scheme. It is essentially the same as the RGB scheme, but a computer monitor will display red as if it is blue and blue as if it is red, distorting the image. To fix this, this function automatically reverses the ordering of BGR to RGB, hence the slicing."
