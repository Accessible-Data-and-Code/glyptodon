    "This callback takes the current [```State```](https://dash.plotly.com/basic-callbacks#dash-app-with-state) of the figure and the page selector to convert that input into sorted ```BBox``` and ```Line``` objects that are then saved to ```csv``` files. There are several components to this code, so they will be explained here with markdown rather than commenting through it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### callback\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@callback(\n",

    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This callback does not actually do anything to update values inside the program. Rather, it takes values and saves them. However, all ```Dash``` callbacks have to have a specified ```Output```. Because of that, a dummy output has been made with an ```html.Div``` object. Additionally, to avoid continuously updating storage this method is only called when the ```save-shapes``` button is clicked. The ```State``` elements are only called when the ```Input``` is triggered. Next, the initial call is prevented as objects referenced in this callback will not have well defined traits until other events have happened. Lastly, the allow duplicate is in place to allow the dummy output to be used in another callback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### function definition\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def saveShapesCallback(clicks, shapes, path):\n",
    "```\n",
    "This method call has to take positional arguments based on the order of the callback. So, the ```save-shapes``` variable of ```n_clicks``` corresponds to ```clicks``` in the positional arguments. The ```shapes``` variable gives us the state of shapes on the figure, allowing us to dig through a list of dictionaries (oddly enough passed in as a dictionary where the list is keyed to ```\"shapes\"```) to extract the shape data. The ```path``` will tell us which image we are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "### data extraction\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dictLines = []\n",
    "dictBBoxes = []\n",
    "for shape in shapes[\"shapes\"]:\n",
    "    if shape[\"type\"] == \"line\":\n",

    "        dictBBoxes.append(shape)\n",
    "```\n",
    "These first set of code just take the ```shapes``` argument and sorts the dictionaries inside the list into either the line or bbox category.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Line construction\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lines = []\n",
    "for line in dictLines:\n",
    "    bboxes.append([])\n",
    "    lines.append(\n",
    "        Line(\n",

    "    )\n",
    "Line.sortLines(lines)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This takes the extracted line dictionary and uses the data stored inside to instantiate ```Line``` objects for every dictionary. It then calls the ```sortLines``` method to not only sort the ```lines``` list but also assign ```index``` values to each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BBox construction\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tempBBoxes = []\n",

    "This takes the extracted bbox dictionary and uses the data stored inside to instantiate ```BBox``` objects for every dictionary. Unfortunately, we want to sort the ```BBox``` objects along two possible coordinates. We want to get bboxes sorted into which text line they are a part of and we want them to be sorted along that line as well. This suggests a coordinate system for the bboxes where any bbox can be assigned to a coordinate $(L,I)$ where $L$ is for the line (a correspondence of the ```Line``` objects ```index``` trait and the ```BBox``` objects ```lineNo``` trait) and  $I$ is for the index of the box on that line (meaning that the further left a word/bbox is on a line the lesser the index). However, that sorting has to happen after construction.\n",

    "            bboxes[-1].append(bbox)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This takes the bboxes stored temporarily and stores them in lists inside of the ```bboxes``` list. First, it constructs an empty list. It then uses the ```isLine``` function to determine if a given ```BBox``` can be assigned to some $L$ (```lineNo```) for the current ```Line``` object in the for loop. Because the ```lines``` list has been sorted, we can be confident that the list we are assigning a ```BBox``` to at the tail end of the ```bboxes``` list will be at an index in ```bboxes``` of ```line.index - 1```.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BBox index sorting and storage preparation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flattenedBBoxes = []\n",
    "for line in bboxes:\n",
    "    BBox.sortBBoxes(line)\n",
    "    flattenedBBoxes = flattenedBBoxes + line\n",
    "```\n",
    "This takes the two dimensional ```bboxes``` list, sorts each list inside with ```sortBBoxes```, and then puts it into one array for easy saving purposes. The ```sortBBoxes``` method is used to assign an ```index``` value for each ```BBox```, necessary for reconstructing the ```BBox``` objects or exporting the generated ```csv``` in another format. The ```flattenedBBoxes``` converts the 2-dimensional ```bboxes``` into a one dimensional list to pass into the ```BBox``` csv constructor method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving objects\n",
    "```python\n",
    "imageName = path.split(\"/\")[-1]\n",

    "Line.linesToCSV(linesDirectory, lines, imageName)\n",
    "BBox.bboxesToCSV(bboxesDirectory, flattenedBBoxes, imageName)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This uses the ```path``` argument to extract a filename as ```imageName``` (reusing code from earlier). Then, the pathway to the ```bboxes``` and ```lines``` directories are established and the particular files written to with the ```...ToCSV``` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dummy output\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dummy = [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"]\n",
    "return dummy\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is in the code because of the ```Dash``` requirement that any callback function has a distinct output relating to one of the components of the application. This method does not actually have any reason to pass output to any object in the application. Thus, the dummy output is used."
