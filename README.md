# glyptodon

Glyptodon is a manuscript annotation tool that uses [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).

At present, it can accept manuscript images for most image formats and manuscript transcriptions in xml.

It cannot use the transcriptions uploaded in xml yet, but it should be able to in future updates.

The purpose of this tool is to create and utilize physical document transcriptions for the digital humanities.
